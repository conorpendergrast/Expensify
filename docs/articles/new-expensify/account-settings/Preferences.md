# How to set your theme preference in New Expensify

To set or update your theme preference in New Expensify: 
1. Go to **Settings > Preferences**
2. Tap on **Theme**
3. You can choose between the _Dark_ theme, the _Light_ theme, or _Use Device Settings_ (which is the default setting)

_Use Device Settings_ is the default setting.

Selecting _Use Device Settings_ will use your device's theme settings. For example, if you have your device set to switch to light theme during daylight hours, and dark theme during after sunset, we'll match that.

Your theme preference will sync across all of the ways you use New Expensify (mobile app, web app or OSX desktop app).
